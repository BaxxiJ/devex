== The purpose of environment variables

Environment variables are used to modifify the behaviour of an application at deployment time. This allows generic container images to be created which can then be told how to behave, or to which systems they should connect, at the deployment time. 

For example, an application that stored user personal data needs to connect to different databases in different phases of the development lifecycle. In the development phase dummy data is used, in the QA phase a larger volume of obfuscated data is used and in production the application connects to a database holding genuine customer data. The following code snippet for Node.JS shows how an environment variable can be read by the application to configure connectivity.

var dbConnection = process.env.DB_CONNECTION;

The diagram below shows the parts introduced in section 1, Deploying an Application to OpenShift. The resources created within the cluster are the route, service and deployment. The deployment is responsible for creating the associated pods that it defines. The files used to create the resources are shown outside the cluster as external entities. A user is shown interacting with the application from outside the cluster via the route.

Environment variables can be applied to the deployment resource. This ensures that they are applied to all instances of the application pods, since the pods may be restarted and scalled up and down. As new pods are created by the application scaling the environment variables will be applied appropriately as shown below.
